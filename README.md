My object oriented programming assignment in creating a program that prints a fee invoice reciept
based on the user inputting their name, D number, course ID and credit hour. 

The program utilizes multiple java packages:
- Date utility
- Scanner
- classes and methods

Techniques used:
1. splitting an array and casting from a string to an integer. `Integer.parseint(array[1]);`
2. Fetching local data from the users machine to gather the time, date, and time zone.
3. Menu formatting
4. Equations to calculate the payments made by the user based on the credit hours they inputted
5. String formatting methods to auto assign brackets and white space to separate the users name and ID#.
